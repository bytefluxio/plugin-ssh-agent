## Install

```fish
$ omf install ssh-agent
```


## Usage

Automatically starts an ssh-agent, when you open your shell.

The ssh-agent is kept alive.

If ssh-agent can't be connected to, all running ssh-agents, that your shell sees (checked via `ps -a`) are shut down and a new one is started.

Since all shells share the ssh-agent, you only have to enter your password once.
